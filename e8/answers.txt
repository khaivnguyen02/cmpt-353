1. KNeighborsClassifier with LAB colour did the best for the colour-prediction task.
Since in LAB colour, distances make sense -> that seems quite related to the predictions and might be more useful for KNN model
where k-nearest neightbours are considered.
RGB is based on the the primary colors of light and is often used for display purposes.
LAB represents colors in terms of their perceptual qualities
HSV separates color information into components that are often more intuitive for tasks involving color manipulation.
Depending on the nature of your dataset and the characteristics of your task, 1 color space may be more suitable than others?

2. Yes, I feel like the models is making reasonable mistakes. 
Weather features that we could potentially add: 
+ wind
+ humidity level
+ sunrise and sunset time

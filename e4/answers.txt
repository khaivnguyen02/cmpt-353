1. Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are
a good way to predict population density? Briefly explain why or why not.

Based on the scatterplot showing no apparent relationship between daily temperatures and population density, 
daily temperatures are not a good way to predict population density 
because there is no clear correlation between the two variables.

2. Several of the (larger) data files were was kept compressed on disk throughout the analysis, 
so they needed to be decompressed ever time we ran our program: that seems inefficient. 
Why might this be faster than working with an uncompressed .json or .csv data?

- It can reduce the amount of disk space required to store the data
=> Fewer read and write operations during data access
=> Faster data retrieval times, especially when dealing with large datasets.

- Compressed files can be transferred more quickly over a network
=> Reducing the time it takes to download / upload

- Compressed files may improve CPU caches utilization
=> faster data processing => boost the performance

1. In the hint above, what is the result of the calculation data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept? What is the type, and describe the values.

The calculation gives us the best fit line for prediction of rating based on the date and rating of the tweet.

Values are the prediction of ratings at the given date.

Type: Float

2. In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph? Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?

- data['prediction'] = data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept is a linear function (function of a line) with the fit.slope and fit.intercept generated using scipy.stats.linregress function.

- created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot since timestamp values (seconds) are generated from the created_at values (datetime objects). We need to convert created_at values to timestamp because the scipy.stats.linregress function only works on numbers, not datetime objects.
